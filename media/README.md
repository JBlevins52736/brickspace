## Usage Guidelines

### For Portfolio Presentation

When using media assets for portfolio or promotional purposes:
1. Maintain aspect ratios for screenshots (16:9 preferred)
2. Include captions or context in portfolio presentations
3. Highlight key features: hand tracking, colocation, multi-user sync
4. Show collaborative building in action

### For Documentation

When adding media to documentation:
1. Reference images using relative paths: `![Description](../media/screenshots/image.png)`
2. Keep file sizes reasonable (< 2MB per image when possible)
3. Use descriptive filenames: `hand-tracking-brick-grab.png` not `image1.png`
4. Optimize images before committing

### File Naming Convention

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `multi-user-colocation-demo.png`
- Include context in name: `assembly-layer-validation.png`
- Version if needed: `ui-menu-v2.png`

## External Media Links

For large files or videos, use external hosting:
- **YouTube**: Public demonstrations and feature showcases
- **Vimeo**: High-quality portfolio presentations
- **Google Drive/Dropbox**: Development footage and raw captures

Add links to external media in `EXTERNAL_MEDIA.md`
